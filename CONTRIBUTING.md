## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Don't open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in the website, and instead contact us directly at [contacto@entgamers.pro](mailto:contacto@entgamers.pro).
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/SrJuggernaut/entgamers_pro/issues)
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, steps to reproduce the issue, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Fixing Bugs

- Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.
- Fork the repository and create a new branch from `preview`.
- Make your changes.
- Ensure the changes pass the linter by running `npm run lint`.
- Submit a pull request.
